data types in c

the memory data tyoes are depend on your os and hardware that you used  

int      can be minus positive and zero, 
         you can assign in a hecadecimal number(base16)  
float    
double values:::64bits:::8byte
char
_Bool   can be used to store just the values 0 or 1 (False or True)

double >>> float

short long unsigned keywords to modify basic integer type

long int money = 100004304304L;
unsigned int counter; only have positives values


enums a data types that allows a programmer to define and
specify the valid values that could be stored into that variables

ex::
  enum primarycolor {red, yellow, blue};
  enum primarycolor mycolor, yourcolor;
